parse change log files, may be that will help normalize changelogs on cpan

* about people
** parse changelogs for contributors
** parse main file in distribution for authors, contributors

* integration with RT
** open bugs, resolved, rejected

* relations between modules
** alternative
*** when modules declared as alternative, we can notify every author of a module
    that depends on any of alternatives to comment which one they prefer and why

* relations should allow external URLs, for example Jifty is used in Doxory,
  so relation should be like: x-local:///model/id, http://..., ftp://

* we should check and complain about an author that mandatorly depend on Test::*
  modules

* if there is no repository declared in the META, we can allow users to define a
  repository and file bug in rt.cpan.org

* we should integrate with sharifulin's service and force him to provide as API
  for CPANID -> country bindings, may be we can contribute him back
* I think we can make this people adjustable content and maintain ACME::CpanAuthors::*
  namespace automatically, like sort of wiki.

* SEE ALSO section of the POD
** We should parse it
** We should propagate people's announced relations back into the CPAN like
   a patch that updates POD, for example when people add info that a module X
   is an alternative for Y, we get list of all alternatives for both and generate
   a SEE ALSO patch
