parse change log files, may be that will help normalize changelogs on cpan

* about people
** parse changelogs for contributors
** parse main file in distribution for authors, contributors

* integration with RT
** open bugs, resolved, rejected

* relations between modules
** alternative
*** when modules declared as alternative, we can notify every author of a module
    that depends on any of alternatives to comment which one they prefer and why

* relations should allow external URLs, for example Jifty is used in Doxory

* we should check and complain about an author that mandatorly depend on Test::*
  modules

* if there is no repository declared in the META, we can allow users to define a
  repository and file bug in rt.cpan.org
