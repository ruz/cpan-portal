Hi, there.

It's an attempt to connect dots in the perl world in one place. It's NOT about abonding
any services, but about bringing them together in one place. Our idea is not to duplicate
services, but sync from them and sync back.

Main thing we try to solve is problem with searching for appropriate solutions for your
needs on the CPAN. It's growing tooo fast, so search.cpan.org is not enough. It's NOT
another search in docs and names of cpan modules. It's search based on metadata, mainly
tags. It's about relations between different modules, distributions, packages and out of
the CPAN projects.

Random documentation you can find in the doc/ dir. There is file with ideas that keeps
growing, so you can start helping by implementing any or add more ideas.

Be ready that this project depends on many modules from the CPAN and our goal is to use
them as long as they suit our needs and even if they don't then first of all try to extend
them.

If you have a question like "Why do you use this? Why don't you use X instead of Y?"
then you better stop right there before asking. That's it, you have high chances to
be send frucking far.

If you still have above question then just fork, replace whatever we use with another
module and request github pull. Be ready to maintain your solution and help others
understand benefits and how to use it in the best way.

That's it for now. Join us and enjoy a journey into the perl world.
